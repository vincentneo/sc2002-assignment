# NTU SC2002 Assignment

This repository holds the contents for the SC2002 assignment. To enable members to test CSV files with potential modifications, all CSV files are not committed in this repository so as to reduce chances of merge conflicts. Please place CSV files in `src/sc2002/FCS1/grp2/files` before first run.

As you use the CLI application, you will notice that, edited or generated CSV files can be found persisted at `bin/sc2002/FCS1/grp2/files`.

## Usage
The entry point of this application is the `BTOManagementApplication` class.

## Javadocs
